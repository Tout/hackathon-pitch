# Hackathon Pitch Outline

## What is Tout?

* Easiest way to shoot and share video

### wat?

* Who knows what Twitter is?
* Who knows what YouTube is?
* Ok, so if those two services got together and had a beautiful, bright blue baby in San Francisco it would be Tout
    * Twitter limits you to 140 characters, we limit you to 15 seconds of video
        * Why 15 seconds? Because most people start to get boring at 16 seconds

## Problem with video

* Capturing
* Transmitting
* Encoding
* Ensuring deliverability
* Playback

## How easy is Tout?

* Show embeddable controls
    * Create a Tout using /m/new and have it show up next to the 'Tout It' button 
* Ruby and Python client libraries

## What about for mobile?

* Got you covered with iOS and Android SDKs
* Provide even more on mobile!
    * Working with native camera components (and across devices) sucks! - We know, we've been doing it for a few years now
